                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>When examining our Lighthouse speed scores for the site and investigating in the Network tab, I
                        noticed a puzzling trend: we had responsive image modules and image compression enabled on the
                        site, but image file sizes were still much larger than I’d expect, especially on mobile.</p>
                    <p>Due to
                        my research and advocacy for improvements, I was able to get the business to prioritize a
                        mulit-phase project, where we took several steps to improve page performance through
                        optimization of media. Over time, we sought to address the following three challenges:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Images on the site are rendering at far larger sizes than expected, especially on mobile.</li>
                        <li>PNG and JPG are not best for page performance, but the entire CMS is comprised of these file formats.</li>
                        <li>Increasing use of animations on the site had led to massive MP4/GIF files.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </section>


            <div class="container">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Based on the three issues above, we split the two into three phases of work:</p>

                <h3>Phase 1: Improve responsive image formats</h3>
                <p>I did extensive research on our current responsive image sizes and
                    settings. I realized that the default values we use for the <code>sizes</code> and <code>srcset</code> attributes on images didn’t encourage the browser to actually pick the smaller size for mobile, even though they are industry standard values. </p>
                    <!-- I found that the “1x, 2x” values
                    typically used for this attribute weren’t cutting it, as there was not enough information on mobile
                    for the browser to actually choose the smaller image. -->
                <p>Thinking big picture, I started testing out various combinations of <code>sizes</code> and <code>srcset</code> values for image tags in an <a href="https://codepen.io/jacquelynmarcella/pen/odRzrw" target="_blank">experimental codepen</a> to determine values that would
                    encourage the browser to render the smaller size file on mobile. Then, I was able to implement those configurations into Drupal into a range of responsive image size options that were integrated into our <a href="design-system.html">global component library</a>.</p>
                        <!-- I had to think through a variety of
                    scenarios for file size needs (e.g. an image might be medium sized on desktop, but technically full
                    screen width on mobile). -->
                <p>As part of this first phase, I also noticed that our background images were skipping our responsive
                    image formatter entirely, due to how background images were authored and themed in the CMS. I wrote
                    new PHP functions in our theme to provide a range of compressed image sizes for backgrounds that
                    get appended as a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, so that the background is style applied like a
                    traditional CSS background, while actually loading a properly sized file on smaller devices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="two-up width-max">
                <div class="flex--50">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/background-size-before.png" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of Network tap, showing 1.5MB file size">
                        <figcaption>Before: Background images were massive at 1.5MB and larger, even on mobile.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <div class="flex--50">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/background-size-after.png" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of Network tab, showing 36.8kB file size">
                        <figcaption>After: The same background image is now down to 36.8kB on mobile.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="container">

                <h3>Phase 2: Implement WebP module to reduce PNG usage </h3>

                <p>After launching the first phase, we knew that even with their newly reduced sizes, PNGs and JPGs were still not optimal for performance. Further research and partnership with the SEO team confirmed that the
                    next best step would be integrating WebP on the site.</p>
                <p>I collaborated with our back end engineers to get the WebP Drupal module installed, which converts
                    regular PNG files into WebP images, allowing our web authors to not have to do any extra work to
                    improve image performance. I did a front end pass on the work, ensuring that the original PNG
                    fallbacks (with the responsive image formats from Phase 1) still worked as expected and that there
                    was no regression in our site’s design or performance.</p>

                <h3>Phase 3: Integrate Lottie to use SVG animations instead of MP4/GIF</h3>
                <p>After improving images, I advocated for the next phase of this work, which was to improve the
                    performance of animating media. Due to the need to make compelling landing pages, large file size
                    MP4s and GIFs were now everywhere on the site. If engineering forced compression of these files,
                    they became so low quality that it was a dealbreaking issue for stakeholders.</p>
                <p>We knew the next step was to shift to SVG-based animations. I supported the engineering and design
                    teams in the effort to integrate Lottie as a supported media type on the site. Now, authors have
                    begun converting pages that once had large MP4s/GIFs into pages with extremely low file size and
                    crisp Lottie format animations.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The first rounds of improving responsive image formats and shifting to WebP led to both file size
                    improvements and SEO wins. This work <b>reduced image file sizes by up to 97%</b>, which resulted in
                    a <b>28% increase in Google image search impressions</b> and a <b>14% uptick in clicks</b>.</p>
                <p>While we don’t have full sitewide conversion to Lottie yet, we are seeing <b>improvements to
                        animation file sizes by over 94%</b> and have launched compelling new pages that are entirely
                    composed of performant SVG animations.</p>
