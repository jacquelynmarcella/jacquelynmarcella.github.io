                <h2>Plan</h2>
                <p>Smartsheet needed to update its website from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. The Drupal 7 site had lots of room for improvement: most of the site's CMS authoring experience was using HTML editors for all content instead of templated content types and there was no unified design system. As a result, most content updates were managed by engineers, rather than web producers.</p>
                <p>The website team recommended that we not only upgrade Drupal versions, but restructure the site using a design system that is component-based, easy to author, modular, and positioned for long term growth as the Smartsheet brand evolves.</p>
                <p>For the front end, rather than using a library like Bootstrap, we determined the best path forward was to leverage the exciting new features that were widely supported in CSS without any special framework. Flexbox, grid, and CSS custom properties could unlock all we needed for a simple variable-based approach to colors, spacing, and overall layout consistency. As the back end team worked on broader system updates, the front end team set out to build an <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">atomic component library</a> folowing the principles of <a href="https://talks.jensimmons.com/15TjNW/designing-intrinsic-layouts" target="_blank">intrinsic design</a>.

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The front end team collaborated with UI/UX designers to build a component system in PatternLab where we could organize everything from button styles (atoms) to grids of tiles (organisms) and use these building blocks to create templates for different content types and pages.</p>
                <p>We didn’t think only about mobile versus desktop and strict concepts like “grid with exactly three items,” but about flexible elements that could adapt based on real-life content needs and the component’s container size, not just the viewport size. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/design-system-large.png" loading="lazy" class="width-content" alt="Component example split half and half to show different elements and how the different color schemes apply to both">
                    <figcaption>Organism level component with button atom and tile molecule, shown in "default" and "event"
                        schemes.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>In Figma Dev Mode (previously in Zeplin and Invision), we have worked with the design team to ensure all global variables/tokens are mapped to all components and redlines. We mapped the full suite of global variables using the semantic CSS custom property names, rather than just designing with hex codes and rigid pixel values, and we use these semantic property names in our build:</p>

                    <div class="flex--50">
                        <figure>

                            <figcaption>The Figma redlines for this molecule use variable names, not just pixel and hex

                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex--50">
                        <figure>
                            <pre>

        padding: 0 var(--md) var(--sm) var(--md);
    }
    svg.caret {
        fill: var(--cardLinkColor);
    }
    .tag {
        background: var(--cardTagBg);
        color: var(--cardTagText);
    }
}</pre>

                </div>
                <p>By using CSS custom properties, we were able to build out dozens of organism-level components that support six color variations across three different schemes (light mode, dark mode, and special events color scheme). This means every component in the entire design system can easily be used in any of these <b>18 different color variations</b> without time-consuming color customizations needed at a per-component level:</p>

                </figure>
                <p>After prototyping in PatternLab, these components were built as Paragraphs within Drupal. These components are built as templated content types for some use cases as well as modular standalone elements a web author can drag and drop within the Bricks UI to build custom page designs. An author can choose the component's color variation and preset size/alignment options, but all choices map back to our established global design system.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Upon initial launch of the new design system and broader site migration, Smartsheet’s primary website had a fresh new look, modern user experience, improved authoring experience, and promising metrics to go with it: <b>the project exceeded its offset goal by +71%, with $1MM in ARR attributed to the website rebuild and migration.</b></p>
                <p>Currently, we have <b>over 10,500 organism-level components</b> in use across the primary website.
                </p>
                <p>Since its inception, we have been able to continually improve our component library to stay on brand and keep up with design standards in the industry, integrating more progressive enhancements and adding new features to components along the way. For example, our tile molecule, pictured below from oldest to newest, has significantly evolved over the years:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/tile-timeline-vertical.png" class="mobile-only" loading="lazy" alt="Caption">
                    <img src="img/tile-timeline-horizontal.png" class="no-mobile" loading="lazy" alt="Caption">
                    <figcaption>The tile molecule has not only improved visually, but expanded to accommodate tags and metadata to better promote article content.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Over my years at Smartsheet, I have grown in responsibility to take on engineering ownership and
                    governance of our global design system and have onboarded new front end engineers into the system. We have conducted a thorough <a href="accessibility.html">accessibility remediation</a> of the component library to ensure it meets WCAG standards. We have since brought this design system to multiple other web properties to ensure cohesion for the Smartsheet web experience.</p>

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>In the long term, the goal is to continue to evolve components while minimizing design system sprawl. We regularly test component performance with approaches like heatmapping and user testing, making sure our interactive components get the engagement we’d expect and continue to find opportunities for improvement.</p>
