                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>When migrating Smartsheet’s websites from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8, the engineering team identified
                        the opportunity to do an entire design system overhaul. Not only should the site look more
                        modern and on brand, it should be modular, have a clear path for visual updates and maintenance,
                        and a component structure that makes it easy for web authors to build pages. </p>
                    <!-- <p>While we had relied on libraries like Bootstrap in the past, we had a lot of frustrations with it (e.g. major breaking updates where you have to comb through your entire codebase to change CSS class names and markup structure and constantly battling styles in the cascade when we wanted to make it our own). We believed that while these frameworks can be helpful in quickly spinning up a new site or launching an MVP, at this time we felt there was a better way for long term maintenance and growth of a multilingual enterprise website of this size.</p> -->

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>We determined the best path forward was to leverage the exciting new features that were widely
                    supported in CSS without any special framework. Flexbox, grid, and CSS custom properties could
                    unlock all we needed for a simple variable-based approach to colors, spacing, and overall layout
                    consistency.</p>
                <p>Taking principles like <a href="https://talks.jensimmons.com/15TjNW/designing-intrinsic-layouts"
                        target="_blank">intrinsic design</a> we set out to build a component library where we didn’t
                    think only about mobile versus desktop and strict concepts like “grid with exactly three items,” but
                    about flexible elements that could adapt based on real-life content needs and the component’s
                    container size, not just the viewport size. </p>
                <p>We set to work collaborating
                    with UI/UX designers to architect an <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"
                        target="_blank">atomic design system</a> in PatternLab where we could organize everything from
                    button styles (atoms) to grids of tiles (organisms) and use these building blocks to create
                    templates for different content types and pages.</p>

                <p>In Figma Dev Mode (previously in Zeplin and Invision), we have worked with the design team to ensure
                    all global variables/tokens are mapped to all components and redlines. We mapped the full suite of
                    global variables using the semantic CSS
                    custom property names, rather than just designing with hex codes and rigid pixel values, and we use
                    these semantic property names in our build:</p>

                <p>Upon initial launch of the new design system and broader site migration, Smartsheet’s primary website
                    had a fresh new look, modern user experience, improved authoring experience, and promising metrics

                <p>Currently, we have <b>over 10,500 organism-level components</b> in use across the primary website.
                </p>
                <p>Since its inception, we have been able to continually improve our component library to stay on brand
                    and keep up with design standards in the industry, integrating more progressive enhancements and
                    adding new features to components along the way.</p>
