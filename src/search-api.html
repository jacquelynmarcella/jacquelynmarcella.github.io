                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>For two of Smartsheet’s primary enterprise web properties, we leveraged Coveo’s Search API for
                        site search functionality. While it is an extremely powerful API, we realized that we were only
                        using a small fraction of its capabilities and that the value of our actual usage was far
                        disproportionate to its cost to the business.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, we found that using a proprietary system felt like a bit of a black box, where it
                        was difficult to control some functionality on our site at the level we would like.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, on the front end side, we felt our approach towards theming, styles, and overrides to
                        Coveo had become disorganized and difficult to maintain and was overdue for a clean-up.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>As engineers on Drupal, an open source CMS, it felt only natural to seek out an open source solution
                    for our search experience. Our back end engineers conducted thorough research and recommended a
                    migration to Open Search’s Search API, an open source option with existing Drupal modules,
                    documentation, and an open source community to lean on for issue resolution.</p>

                <p>While our back end engineers worked to integrate the new API, my role on this project was to lead the
                    front end rebuild to support the updated search functionality. The team did two migrations
                    concurrently on two different enterprise websites:</p>

                <h3>Help Center Site</h3>
                <p>Included not only a migration, but included partnering closely with UI/UX designers to do a design
                    overhaul to improve the UI/UX of facets, sorts, and results on a single search experience.</p>

                <h3>Primary Smartsheet Site</h3>
                <p>This site contained dozens of search experiences across various areas of the site, so it needed a
                    broader approach that minimized redundant theming and templates. This effort included a
                    consolidation of numerous repetitive Coveo templates into a centralized Drupal View template.</p>
                <p>I made it easy to spin up new search Views that contained styled filters and consistent visual
                    components. Because these search experiences were styled to match our <a
                        href="design-system.html">global component system</a>, I was able to integrate our existing
                    component theming (e.g. our tile/card molecule) into the search experience in a more efficient way
                    than we had done previously.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>After completing the migration, Smartsheet was able to scale back their contract with Coveo
                    substantially, which <b>saves the business $150k annually</b>.</p>
                <p>We completed our migration on both sites without any downtime or disruption to the user experience.
                    For both sites, we now have a simplified front end approach that is far easier to maintain and
                    expand upon in the future.</p>
