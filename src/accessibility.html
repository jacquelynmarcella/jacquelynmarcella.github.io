                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>An in-depth accessibility audit confirmed what our engineering team had hypothesized: there were
                        several opportunities for accessibility improvements on the front end of our website, especially
                        in regards to interactive elements.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Automated tools can provide some direction, but our ability to identify issues required education
                        and manual testing efforts to ensure content on the site is able to be accessed by all visitors.
                        Additionally, we needed to ensure that improving accessibility of our site would not create new
                        complexities that were impossible to maintain for our CMS authors.</p> -->
                    <p>
                        One of the more complex findings was on the Plans and Pricing page, which is one of the highest
                        trafficked pages on the primary Smartsheet website. The large data table was inaccessible as it
                        read out all content at once, not providing users with an ability to parse through relationships
                        between row and column headers. It also lacked
                        a caption and used icons in lieu of text content without providing icon labels for screen
                        readers.

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Leading the front end effort, I helped provide recommendations for a plan of action for the team to
                    organize our work by component and by the types of issues to resolve.</p>
                    <p>There were several trends we
                    found that were able to apply learnings across our <a href="design-system.html">component-based system</a>. Many areas were
                    straightforward updates to active focus states and color contrast, which we collaborated with the
                    design team to update our global color variable values and centralized component styles accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>For the Plans and Pricing table, after thorough research on the best way to incorporate accordion headers into a data table, I rebuilt
                    the table’s structure as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/"
                        target="_blank">treegrid pattern</a>.</p>
                <p>I kept the authoring experience simple, because this table is currently authored in a rich text
                    editor, which has proved to be the easiest way for website authors to update data in a table this
                    complex without consistent engineering support.</p>
            </div>

            </figure>

            <div class="container">
                <p>Because this table is in a rich text field, it meant that hardcoding <code>aria</code> attributes directly into
                    the editor was a non-starter, as this would be easily subject to breaking given the complex
                    <code>aria-count</code> values and parent/child data that need to be present to describe the treegrid data
                    structure. Therefore, the most sustainable approach was to write JavaScript that would parse the
                    table and add accordion functionality and assign appropriate <code>aria</code> values to the elements.</p>

                <p>Throughout this project, I collaborated with other engineers, having them code review and test my
                    work on their devices and provide further feedback for improvement. I also conducted code review on
                    their component refactors to ensure we were all learning from the accessibility improvements so we
                    could be on the same page about best practices moving forward.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>By implementing a sitewide remediation effort, we <b>surpassed our original goal of 90%+ WCAG 2.1 AA
                        compliance</b>. The front end team now had an improved understanding of proper standards for
                    accessibility that should be adhered to for future projects.</p>


                <p>For the Pricing and Plans table, the updated experience allows for keyboard navigation throughout the
                    table using the expected treegrid keyboard commands and a much smoother expeirence for screen
                    readers. Using the keyboard only, a user can open and close sections, navigate through
                    entire rows or single columns at a time, get information describing rather than no content
                    (checkmarks are described as “Included” rather than as an empty cell), and the table has a
                    visually-hidden caption that provides an overview of its purpose to screen readers before reading
                    all of the data within.</p>

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>Moving forward, we now leverage tools like WebAIM and Lighthouse for a quick automatic check of items, and NVDA for
                    validating screen reader experiences, but we understand the importance of manually checking items
                    within the context of their intended purpose, which an automated testing tool alone would not catch.
                </p>
                <p>I continue to stay informed about accessibility best practices through resources like [a11y
                    newsletter link]. The engineering team is exploring adding more supporting features to the site,
                    like the Editoria11y module[link] to help authors check their content for proper outline structure,
                    image alt tags, and other common points of failure for accessibility.</p>
